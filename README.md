# Welcome to Expensifly, a new, modern way to track your expenses

Expensifly is a project that is meant to help me learn react, javascript and full stack web development. It started as my interest project, but now it evolved to a more complex page.

# Expensifly benefits

I never truly found an app that would help me track my expenses in a convenient and easy way, so I decided to build my own page for that. As I worked on it more I added a lot of extra functionality and plan on expanding it further.
